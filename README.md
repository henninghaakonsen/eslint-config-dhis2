# ESLint configuration DHIS2

The single source for your JS code style rules.

This is a config for [ESLint](http://eslint.org).

The current styleguide is based on the AirBnB styleguide. Refer to the [AirBnb config file](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/eslint-config-airbnb-v0.0.7/packages/eslint-config-airbnb/.eslintrc) for a view on what this config is based on.

The DHIS2 JS Styleguide differs on a few points which are configured in [our own config](https://github.com/dhis2/eslint-config-dhis2/blob/master/.eslintrc) as overrides

For a more elaborate description of the style guide refer currently refer to the [AirBnB guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/eslint-config-airbnb-v0.0.7)
